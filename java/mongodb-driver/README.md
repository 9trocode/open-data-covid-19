# Java & MongoDB Driver Code Sample

## Dependencies

- Java 8 at least
- Maven 3.6.3


## Run

To run this code sample, simply run: 

```sh
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mongodb.coronavirus.MongoDB"
```

If you don't have Maven and Java 8+ setup correctly, but you have Docker, you can run the `test-with-docker.sh` script instead.
